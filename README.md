# Multi-Intent-Prediction-Based-on-EMG
We have designed this work for continuous multi-intent prediction. 
Please note that the data is placed in './Dada/', while the trained model is saved in './Model/'. The 'utilities_multi' can process data for sliding windows. And this program is carried on Tensorflow-v2.
Please run the 'test_result' to test the prediction performance of an example subject. The accuracy and RÂ² are calculated and printed. Additionall, the comparison of true label and prediction result are displayed on three figures and saved in 'Result_figures'.
